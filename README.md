# Sensor-Based-Human-Activity-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
Developed MLP and LSTM models to classify PIR sensor activity data, achieving over 99% accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation. Applied SMOTE, early stopping, and model checkpointing. Tools: PyTorch, Scikit-learn. This project was created as part of the coursework for the course Deep Learning.
